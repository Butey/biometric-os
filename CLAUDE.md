# CLAUDE.md - Coding Profile
# Best for: dev projects, code review, debugging, refactoring
# Extends: Universal CLAUDE.md rules

---

## Output
- Return code first. Explanation after, only if non-obvious.
- No inline prose. Use comments sparingly - only where logic is unclear.
- No boilerplate unless explicitly requested.

## Code Rules
- Simplest working solution. No over-engineering.
- No abstractions for single-use operations.
- No speculative features or "you might also want..."
- Read the file before modifying it. Never edit blind.
- No docstrings or type annotations on code not being changed.
- No error handling for scenarios that cannot happen.
- Three similar lines is better than a premature abstraction.

## Review Rules
- State the bug. Show the fix. Stop.
- No suggestions beyond the scope of the review.
- No compliments on the code before or after the review.

## Debugging Rules
- Never speculate about a bug without reading the relevant code first.
- State what you found, where, and the fix. One pass.
- If cause is unclear: say so. Do not guess.

## Simple Formatting
- No em dashes, smart quotes, or decorative Unicode symbols.
- Plain hyphens and straight quotes only.
- Natural language characters (accented letters, CJK, etc.) are fine when the content requires them.
- Code output must be copy-paste safe.

## Workflow
- The `dev` branch and the dev worktree are abandoned (2026-10-07). Work and commit directly on `main` in `/opt/webapps/health_agent_system`.
- All checks green before committing; after a change that affects the running bot, restart bot and admin panel and verify both came up, but only on the user's explicit command (a restart cuts an in-flight reply).
- Tests never write to the live DB: set `HEALTH_DB` to a temp path before importing anything that pulls in `health_core.db`.
